## Task 1: Build a function-based console log message generator
In this exercise, your task is to code a function named `consoleStyler`, which accepts four parameters:
- `color`
- `background`
- `fontSize`
- `txt`

Inside the body of the consoleStyler() function declaration, you need to do the following:

1. Create a new variable named message, and assign the following to it on the very first line inside the consoleStyler() function body.: 
    ```
    "%c" + txt;
    ```

    Tip: Do not copy the 3 back ticks. These are used to format this document in the Preview tab.

2. Create a style variable and assign the following to it on the next line: 
    ```
    `color: ${color};`
    ```
	
	Tip: The single backtick before color and after the semi-colon must be included.

3. Next, update the style variable (using the += operator) with the following code: 
    ```
    `background: ${background};`
    ```
	
	Tip: The single backtick before background and after the semi-colon must be included.

4. Then, update the style variable (again, using the += operator) with the following code: 
    ```
    `font-size: ${fontSize};`
    ```
	
	Tip: The single backtick before font-size and after the semi-colon must be included.

5. Finally, console log the message and style variables inside the `` function declaration.

Hint: Be sure to use backticks (``) when updating your variable styles and not single ('') or double ("") quotes.

<br>

## Task 2: Build another console log message generator. 

Your task is to code another function, and name it `celebrateStyler()`. The function accepts a single parameter, reason, which should be of string data type.

Inside the function declaration's body, code the following: 

1. A new variable, named    , assigning it this code:
    ```
    "color: tomato; font-size: 50px";
    ```

2. On the next line, an if statement, verifying that `reason == "birthday"`. 

3. Inside the body of the if block, code the following: 
    ```
    console.log(`%cHappy birthday`, fontStyle);
    ```

4. On the next line, add an else if, and inside the parentheses, check that 
    ```
    reason == "champions"
    ```

5. Inside the else if block, add this code: 
    ```
    console.log(`%cCongrats on the title!`, fontStyle);
    ```

6. Add an else block, with the following code inside of it: 
    ```
    console.log(message, style);
    ```

<br>

## Task 3: Run both the consoleStyler and the celebrateStyler functions

1. Invoke the consoleStyler() function, with the following arguments:

    - `'#1d5c63'`

    - `'#ede6db'`

    - `'40px'`

    - `'Congrats!'`

2. Next, invoke the celebrateStyler() function, with the following argument:

    - `'birthday'`


## Task 4: Insert a congratulatory and custom message

1. Code another function, named `styleAndCelebrate()`.   
The function declaration's body should consist of two function invocations:
    ```
    consoleStyler(color, background, fontSize, txt);  
    celebrateStyler(reason);
    ```


2. Next, invoke the new function, using the following arguments:

    - `'ef7c8e'`
    - `'fae8e0'`
    - `'30px'`
    - `'You made it!'`
    - `'champions'`

## Task 1: Code a Person class

Code a Person class, with three parameters in the constructor: name, age, and energy.

Set the default parameters in the Person class as follows:

```
name = "Tom"

age = 20

energy = 100
```

Code two methods in the `Person` class. Name those methods `sleep()` and `doSomethingFun()`.

The `sleep()` method should take the existing energy level and increase it by 10.

The doSomethingFun() method should take the existing energy level and decrease it by 10.
<br><br>

## Task 2: Code a Worker class

Code a sub-class, inheriting from the `Person` class, and name it `Worker`.

The `Worker` class has two additional parameters in the constructor: 
- xp (for "experience points")
- hourlyWage.

These properties are set to the following default values:
```
xp = 0

hourlyWage = 10
```
The `Worker` class has all the paramerters and methods of its super-class.

Additionally, it has the `goToWork()` method, which, whenever it's run, increases the value of the `xp` property by 10.
<br><br>

## Task 3: Code a intern object

Inside the intern function instantiate the `Worker` class to code a new intern object.

The intern should have the following characteristics:
```
name: Bob

age: 21

energy: 110

xp: 0

hourlyWage: 10
```

Run the `goToWork()` method on the intern object. Then `return` the intern object.

<br><br>


## Task 4: Code a manager object

Inside the manager function instantiate the `Worker` class to code a new `manager` object.

The manager object should have the following characteristics:
```
name: Alice

age: 30

energy: 120

xp: 100

hourlyWage: 30
```

Run the `doSomethingFun()` method on the manager object. Then `return` the manager object.

## Task: Iterate Over an Array

In this exercise, you'll use the for....of loop to iterate over an array and to iterate over an object's own properties.  
<br><br>
**Step 1.** You are given an array of dairy products:  

    
    var dairy = ['cheese', 'sour cream', 'milk', 'yogurt', 'ice cream', 'milkshake']
    
Create a function called `logDairy`. Within it, console log each of the items in the dairy array, using the for...of loop.   

After you create this function, call it as `logDairy()` to see the output on the console.

The expected output should be:

```
cheese
sour cream
milk
yogurt
ice cream
milkshake
```

<br>
<b>Step 2.</b> You are given the following starter code:  

```
const animal = {

canJump: true

};

const bird = Object.create(animal);

bird.canFly = true;

bird.hasFeathers = true;
```

Create a function called `birdCan`, within it, loop over the bird object's properties and console log each one, using the for...of loop. Finally call the function as `birdCan()` to see the output on the console.
Remember, you need to console log both the key and the value of each of the bird object's properties.

<br/>
Expected output should be:

```
canFly: true
hasFeathers: true
```


<br>
<b>Step 3.</b> 
    Using the same starter code as in task 2, create a function called `animalCan` and within it, loop over all the properties in both the bird object and its prototype - the animal object - using the for...in loop. Finally call the function as `animalCan()` to see the output on the console.

<br/><br/>
Expected outout should be:

```
canFly: true
hasFeathers: true
canJump: true
```
<br><br>
