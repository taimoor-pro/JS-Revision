Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI)

Interestingly, the browser has a feature known as "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion" - meaning, it does a pretty good job of "filling in the blanks" in case there is a missing semi-colon where there should be one.

Effectively, what that means for developers is that most of the time, it makes no difference if a semi-colon is added or not, since the browser is likely to figure it out anyway.

That's why some developers say that you shouldn't bother with adding semi-colons at all.

However, other developers argue that it's better to use it wherever it's needed - for the sake of clarity.

The truth is that most of the time, you can think of adding semi-colons in JavaScript as optional - and somewhat of a stylistic preference.
