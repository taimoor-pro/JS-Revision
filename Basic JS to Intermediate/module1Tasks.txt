-- Exercise: Declaring variables

In this exercise, you will practice declaring variables.

To check the output of your code, please enter it into the text box provided and click the "Run" button. This will execute the code and display the resulting output.
Tasks

    Declare a new variable named petDog and give it the name Rex.

    Declare a new variable named petCat and give it the name Pepper.

    Console.log the petDog variable.

    Console.log the petCat variable.

    Console.log the text "My pet dog's name is: " and the petDog variable.

    Console.log the text "My pet cat's name is: " and the petCat variable.

    Declare another variable and name it catSound. Assign the string of "purr" to it.

    Declare another variable and name it dogSound. Assign the string of "woof" to it.

    Console.log the variable petDog, then the string "says", then the variable dogSound.

    Console.log the variable petCat, then the string "says", then the variable catSound.

    Reassign the value stored in catSound to the string "meow".

    Console.log the variable petCat, then the string "now says", then the variable catSound.

Make sure to output all your variables. Feel free to play.

-- Task 1: Using the logical && operator

You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

    Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

    Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

-- Task 2: Using the logical || operator

Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

    Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

    Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

    Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".

-- Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd

You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:

    The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.

    The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.

    The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number.

    The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.

    The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test1 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.

    The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.

Run console log two times after you've set the variables:

    The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1

    The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2

Note: The output to the console should be as follows:

Is 2 an even number? true

Is 5 an even number? false

-- Task 4: Add numbers using the + operator

Console log the result of adding two numbers, 5 and 10, using the + operator.

Note: This task should be completed on a single line of code. The output in the console should be 15.

-- Task 5: Concatenate numbers and strings using the + operator

Code three variables:

    The first variable should be a string with the following value: "Now in ". Name the variable now.

    The second variable should be a number with the value: 3. Name the variable three.

    The third variable should a string with the following value: "D!". Name the variable d.

    Console log the following code: now + three + d.

Note: The expected output should be: "Now in 3D!".

-- Task 6: Use the += operator to accumulate values in a variable

Code a new variable and name it counter, assigning it to the value of 0.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 5.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 3.

On the fourth line, console log the value of the counter variable.

Note: The output value should be 8.

-- Exercise: Practice conditional statements
Introduction

In this exercise, you will practice working with if else statements. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to write an if else statement that determines your source of income based on your age. You will also be able to write a switch statement that determines your evening routine based on the day of the week.
Complete the following steps to create: Are You Old Enough? 

    Declare a variable age using the var keyword and set it to the number 10.

    Add an if statement that checks if the value of the age variable is greater than or equal to the number 65. Inside the if block, console.log the sentence: "You get your income from your pension".

    Add an "else if",  where you'll check if the value of the age is less than 65 and greater than or equal to 18. Inside this "else if" block, type "console.log" and then "Each month you get a salary".

    Add another "else if", and this time check if the value of the age is under 18. Inside the "else if" block, "type console.log" and then "You get an allowance".

    Add an "else" statement to capture any other value. Inside the block, type "console.log" and then "The value of the age variable is not numerical".

Try adjusting the age and executing the program to see how it will affect the output.
Code the days of the week program as a switch statement

    On the next line, define a new variable, name it day, and set its value to "Sunday".

    Start coding a switch statement, passing the day variable as the expression to evaluate.

    Inside the switch, add cases for every day of the week, starting with 'Monday', and ending with 'Sunday'. Make sure to use string values for days. Inside each case, for now, just add a console.log('Do something'), and add a break; on the line below.

    At the very bottom of the switch statement, add the default case and add a console.log('There is no such day').

    Finally, update the console.log calls for each case, based on whatever activity you have on each of the days.

Tips

    If you need to make sure that multiple conditions are true in an if statement, you can do so using the && operator

    In JavaScript, the correct syntax of the "greater than or equal to" operator is: >=.

    Don't forget to add a break at the very end of each case in a switch statement.

-- Exercise: Working with conditionals and loops

Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will create the code for a for loop, using the counter variable named i starting from 1.

To make the counter increment by 1 on each loop, you will use i++.

The exit condition for the for loop should match the output given below. 

Inside the loop, write an if-else statement, which will check the following conditions:

    First, it will check if the value of i is 1. If it is, your code will console log the string "Gold medal".

    Next, I will check if the value of i is 2. If it is, your code will console log the string "Silver medal".

    Then, your code will check if the value of i is 3. If it is, it will console log the string "Bronze medal".

    For all the remaining values of i, your code will console log just the value of i.

Note: The expected console log of the entire code should be as follows.

Gold medal

Silver medal

Bronze medal

4

5

6

7

8

9

10


-- Exercise 2. Use the completed code from the previous task, but convert the conditionals to a switch statement.

When you code the solution, the output in the console should remain exactly the same as in the previous question.

Note: You'll need three separate cases for the three medals, and a default case for all other values of the i variable.
